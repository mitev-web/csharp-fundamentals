Add a static field and a property IPhone4S in the GSM class to hold the information about iPhone 4S.
Write a class GSMTest to test the GSM class:
Create an array of few instances of the GSM class.
Display the information about the GSMs in the array.
Display the information about the static property IPhone4S.
