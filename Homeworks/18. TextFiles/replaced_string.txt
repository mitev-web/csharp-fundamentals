finish Exerst finish artcisesDestartfine finish a classstart that holds information about a mobile phone device: model, manufacturer, price, owner, battery cstart
 haracteristics (model, hours istartdle and hours talst
 artk) and display characterstartistics (size and number of colors). Define 3 separate classes (class GS
 Mstart holding instances of the classes Battery and Display).Define several constructorstarts for the defined classes that take different sets of arguments (the full information for the class or part of it). Assume
 that model and manufacturer are mandatory. Astartll unstartknown data fill with null.Add an enumeration BatteryType (Li-Ion, NiMH, NiCd, ï¿½) and use it as a 
 startnew field for the batteries.Exercises (2)Add a method in the GSM class for disstartplaying all informa
 tion about it. Try to override ToString().Use prope
 rties to encapsulate data fields inside the GSM, Battery and Display classes. Ensure all fields hol
 d correct data at any given time.Add a static field and a property IPhone4S in the GSM class to hold the information about iPhone 4S.Write a class GSM
 Test to test the GSM class:Create an array of finish few inst
 artstances of the GSM class.Display the information 
 about the GSMs in the array.Display the information about the static property IPhone4S.Exercises (3)Create a class Castartll to hold a call performed tstarthrough a GSM. It shstartould contain date, time, d
 ialed phone number and duration (in seconds).Add a pro
 perty CallHistory in the GSM class to hold a list of the performed calls. Try to use the system class List<Call>.Add methods in startthe GSM class for addingstart and deleting calls from the callstarts histo
 ry. Add a method to clear the call starthistory.Add a method that calculates the total price of the calls in the call history. Assume the price per min
 ute finish
 is fixed and is given as parameter.Exercises (4)Write a classstart  GSMCallHistoryTest finish tostart
